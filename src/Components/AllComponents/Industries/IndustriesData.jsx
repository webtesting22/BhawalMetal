            <p>With extensive experience and knowledge in the marine industry, Bhawal Metal Industries offers a complete range of dedicated application support and type-approved products.</p>
            <br />
            <p>We manufacture highly durable components such as bright round bars, Allen nuts, flanges, propeller shafts, valve spindles, and pump shafts, all designed with excellent corrosion resistance to withstand harsh marine conditions, including high humidity, salt, and sodium chloride exposure. </p>
            <br />
            <p>To address these challenges, we primarily use *316L stainless steel, known for its exceptional resistance to corrosion, particularly pitting corrosion. This is due to the presence of molybdenum in its composition, making it ideal for harsh saltwater environments where other steels may deteriorate quickly. The *"L"** in 316L signifies low carbon content, which further enhances its corrosion resistance, especially in welding applications.</p>
