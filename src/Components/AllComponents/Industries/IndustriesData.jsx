            <p>Deriving from our vast experience and knowledge of the marine business, Bhawal Metal Industries creates a complete cache of dedicated application support and type-approved products.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Bhawal Metal Industries Manufactures highly durable components like Bright Round bars, Allen Nuts, Flanges, Propeller Shafts, Valve spindles, Pump Shafts with corrosion resistance capabilities to withstand harsh climatic conditions like humidity, excess presence of Salt, sodium Chloride and Humidity.</p>
            <br />
            <p>To Deal with the following issues we majorly use 316L material because of its exceptional resistance to corrosion, particularly pitting corrosion, caused by the presence of molybdenum in its composition, making it ideal for harsh saltwater environments where other steels might quickly deteriorate; the "L" signifies a low carbon content which further enhances its corrosion resistance, especially when welding is required.</p>
